Mirah.hpi
---------

Trying to write a Hudson's plugin with Mirah.

Compile and test it with Hudson
-------------------------------

This plugin assumes you have Mirah compiled into a sibling
directory, if not execute this before:

cd .. && git clone git://github.com/mirah/mirah.git && cd mirah && jruby -S rake jar:complete

mvn clean process-classes hpi:run

If we want to generate the java source code we need to uncomment the right
plugin into the pom.xml run `mvn validate` that generates the java source code, comment
both ant plugins into the pom.xml and run `mvn comile`.

Current status
--------------

The plugin compiles and it's detected by Hudson but the extension point
doesn't appear anywhere.

If we generate the java source code from the mirah source code and we
compile it the plugin works like a charm.
