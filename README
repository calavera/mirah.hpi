Mirah.hpi
---------

Trying to write a Hudson's plugin with Mirah.

Compile and test it with Hudson
-------------------------------

This plugin assumes you have Mirah compiled into a sibling
directory, if not execute this before:

cd .. && git clone git://github.com/mirah/mirah.git && cd mirah && jruby -S rake jar:complete

The build is still quite hacky and it needs few steps:

  # Comment the antrun plugin into the pom.xml and execute `mvn compile`,
    this will compile the mirah dependencies and wrappers.
  # Uncomment the plugin and execute the same command again, this will
    generate the java source code from Mirah and will compile it.
  # Run `mvn hpi:run` to load the hudson test instance.

If we want to generate the java source code we need to uncomment the right
plugin into the pom.xml run `mvn validate` that generates the java source code, comment
both ant plugins into the pom.xml and run `mvn comile`.

Current status
--------------

The plugin compiles and it's detected by Hudson but the extension point
doesn't appear anywhere.

If we generate the java source code from the mirah source code and we
compile it the plugin works like a charm.
