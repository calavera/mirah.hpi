Mirah.hpi
---------

Trying to write a Hudson's plugin with Mirah.

Compile and test it with Hudson
-------------------------------

This plugin assumes you have Mirah and JRuby compiled into a sibling
directory, if not execute this before:

cd .. && git clone git://github.com/jruby/jruby.git && cd jruby && ant jar-complete
cd .. && git clone git://github.com/mirah/mirah.git && cd mirah && jruby -S rake jar:complete

mvn hpi:run

Current status
--------------

The plugin compiles and it's detected by Hudson but the extension point
doesn't appear anywhere. My hint is that Hudson cannot detect which kind of
extension is because the descriptor class, line 42 in
hello_world_builder.mirah, doesn't use the generic <Builder>
and Mirah doesn't support generics right away.
