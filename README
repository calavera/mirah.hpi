Mirah.hpi
---------

Trying to write a Hudson's plugin with Mirah.

Compile and test it with Hudson
-------------------------------

This plugin assumes you have Mirah and JRuby compiled into a sibling
directory, if not execute this before:

cd .. && git clone git://github.com/jruby/jruby.git && cd jruby && ant jar-complete
cd .. && git clone git://github.com/mirah/mirah.git && cd mirah && jruby -S rake jar:complete

mvn hpi:run

Current status
--------------

The plugin compiles and it's detected by Hudson but the extension point
doesn't appear anywhere.

As soon as we can make mirah generate public static final fields rather than private
static fields for the descriptor in that line the plugin will be fully
functional:
